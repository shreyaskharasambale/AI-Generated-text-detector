# AI-generated-text-detector

This project's primary objective is to create an AI-generated text detection system. I am training my classification model 
on Quora websitesâ€™ data. This system will be created to target and precisely identify answers that are likely to be 
produced by AI, helping to maintain the integrity of the Quora platform and provide users with accurate and 
trustworthy information. 

Objective 1: To collect and prepare a diverse dataset of Quora questions and answers, encompassing both human
written and AI-generated responses from ChatGPT for the same questions, to create a comprehensive training and 
evaluation dataset.  

Objective 2: To perform data preprocessing that removes any irrelevant or sensitive information from the collected 
data, ensuring it is ready for feature engineering. 

Objective 3: To conduct extensive feature engineering to extract relevant lexical, syntactic, and semantic features from 
the prepared dataset and to test their significance using a random forest classifier machine learning model individually 
and proceed towards feature selection based on the performance metrics of the extracted features. 

Objective 4: To train a random forest classifier machine learning model using the selected features and the carefully 
curated dataset, optimizing its performance to accurately detect AI-generated answers on the Quora platform. 

Objective 5: To ensure compliance with privacy and ethical guidelines throughout the project, safeguarding user data 
and promoting responsible use of the AI detection system to maintain Quora's integrity and provide users with 
trustworthy information.
